NAME
    "Net::LibResolv" - a Perl wrapper around libresolv

SYNOPSIS
     use Net::LibResolv qw( res_query NS_C_IN NS_T_A );
     use Net::DNS::Packet;
 
     my $answer = res_query( "www.cpan.org", NS_C_IN, NS_T_A );
     defined $answer or die "DNS failure\n";
 
     foreach my $rr ( Net::DNS::Packet->new( \$answer )->answer ) {
        print $rr->string, "\n";
     }

DESCRIPTION
    The libresolv library provides functions to use the platform's standard
    DNS resolver to perform DNS queries. This Perl module provides a
    wrapping for the two primary functions, res_query(3) and res_search(3),
    allowing them to be used from Perl.

    The return value from each function is a byte buffer containing the
    actual DNS response packet. This will need to be parsed somehow to
    obtain the useful information out of it; most likely by using Net::DNS.

FUNCTIONS
  $answer = res_query( $dname, $class, $type )
    Calls the res_query(3) function on the given domain name, class and type
    number. Returns the answer byte buffer on success, or "undef" on
    failure.

    $dname should be a plain string. $class and $type should be numerical
    codes. See the "CONSTANTS" section for convenient definitions.

  $answer = res_search( $dname, $class, $type )
    Calls the res_search(3) function on the given domain name, class and
    type number. Returns the answer byte buffer on success, or "undef" on
    failure.

    $dname should be a plain string. $class and $type should be numerical
    codes. See the "CONSTANTS" section for convenient definitions.

CONSTANTS
  Class IDs
    The following set of constants define values for the $class parameter.
    Typically only "NS_C_IN" is actually used, for Internet.

     NS_C_IN NS_C_CHAOS NS_C_HS
     NS_C_INVALD NS_C_NONE NS_C_ANY

  Type IDs
    The following are examples of constants define values for the $type
    parameter. (They all follow the same naming pattern, named after the
    record type, so only a few are listed here.)

     NS_T_A NS_T_NS NS_T_CNAME NS_T_PTR NS_T_MX NS_T_TXT NS_T_SRV NS_T_AAAA
     NS_T_INVALID NS_T_ANY
